Hello and welcome to this short journey through the world of creation! I wanted to share the process behind my digital art.

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:20.471
First and foremost, I place the pen on the screen and sketch out a basic idea.

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:26.914
Today, I'm starting with an old sketch as a foundation because digital art can truly be a time-consuming adventure.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:39.251
After being content with the sketch, I move on to the next step. I lay down base colors, and in today's creation, I've chosen a calming purple palette.

00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:44.319
But let's take it step by step, in a friendly and inviting manner, using Clip Studio Paint.

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:50.756
Join me on this artistic journey, and let's explore the creative possibilities together.

Thank you for being here, and I look forward to sharing this artwork with you as it takes shape.
